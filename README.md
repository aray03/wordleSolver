This is a genaric Wordle solver I made because I am generally terrible at Wordle. You run this script while you are playing Wordle.

Reqirements:
Java

HowTo:
- Run the WordleSolver.java
- Plug in the word you had put in the wordle
- Based on what color you get, match the corrosponding color with the word
     - g: green
     - y: yellow
     - n: no color
     - Example:
         - alert
         - gynny
- Repeat until you find the word, or run out of words.


Note: This is a work in progress and will still have some bugs. Currently I do not filter out a yellow locations when a specific letter is there, which will be fixed eventually.
