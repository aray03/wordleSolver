# wordleSolver
## The project is 90% completed
This is a genaric Wordle solver I made because I am generally terrible at Wordle. You run this script while you are playing Wordle.

Reqirements:
Java

HowTo:
- Run the WordleSolver.java, by compiling and running it.
- Plug in the word you had put in the wordle
- Based on what color you get, match the corrosponding color with the word
     - g: green
     - y: yellow
     - n: no color
     - Example:
         - alert
         - gynny
- Repeat until you find the word, or run out of words, which shouldn't happen, but it may

Note: This is generally finished but will still have some bugs. I am not the proudest about how it all runs/works so I will go back in sometime and pretty it up

Also contains 2 wordbanks, one with all Wordle words in the creator's wordbank, and the other that doesn't contain already used words
